PDFChords
=========

PDFChords is a graphical interface based on <a href="http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/chordpro/index.html" target="new">Chordii</a>, a command-line tool to convert guitar sheets in <a href="http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/chordpro/index.html" target="new">Chord/ChordPro</a> format into PDF files. It includes a browser to quickly jump between chord sheets and an editor with syntax highlighting and chord completion. The generated PDF files are previewed and changes are made immediately visible. Since most guitar tabs on the web are two line style song sheets, PDFChords offers the possibility to convert them to ChordPro. PDFchords is developed in C#/WPF and runs on Windows (tested on Windows 7/10 only).
