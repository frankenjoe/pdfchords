PDFChords
=========

PDFChords is a GUI wrapper for <a href="http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/chordpro/index.html" target="new">Chordii</a>, a command-line tool to convert guitar sheets in <a href="http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/chordpro/index.html" target="new">Chord/ChordPro</a> format into PDF files. It includes a browser to quickly jump between chord sheets and an editor with syntax highlighting and chord completion to edit files. An in-built pdf viewer allows it to preview and print converted sheets. Since most guitar tabs on the web are two line style song sheets, PDFChords offers the possibility to convert them to the ChordPro format and insert directives (both functions are available from the editor's context menu). PDFchords is developed in C#/WPF and runs on Windows (tested on Windows 7, only).
